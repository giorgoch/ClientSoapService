		1. Disclaimer
		-------------
		The information published
		and the positions expressed on this European
		TIN Portal are those of
		the authors and do not necessarily reflect the
		views of the European
		Commission. While the European TIN Portal is run
		by the European
		Commission, responsibility for its content is shared
		between the
		Commission and individual EU Member States: content pages
		are either
		"European" in nature or "Member State" pages, where each EU
		Member
		State is responsible for the content and the links on its own
		pages.

		The European Commission maintains this European TIN Portal to allow
		persons subject to a specific tax reporting obligation imposed to them
		by European or national legislation, and having an Internet access to:
		* obtain information on the national systems of identification of
		taxpayers and more specifically on the Tax Identification Numbers
		(TINs) and
		* use a TIN online check module for checking whether the
		syntax (i.e.
		algorithm) of a TIN is valid or, when the specifications
		of the syntax
		(i.e. algorithm) are not available, whether the structure
		of the TIN
		is valid. As such, the TIN online check module neither
		confirms the
		existence and actual allocation of a TIN nor the identity
		of a person.
		The TIN online check module only confirms that, on the
		basis of the
		specifications provided by the EU Member States to the
		European
		Commission, the TIN specified corresponds to the general
		structure of
		TINs designed and in force in a country and, if explicitly
		stated, it
		corresponds to the algorithm designed and in force in that
		country.

		Any other use and any extraction and use of the information
		and data
		which is not in conformity with these objectives as well as
		the
		copyright notices and rules relating to the protection of personal
		data and privacy as described hereafter are strictly forbidden.

		This
		information is:
		* of a general nature only and is not intended to
		address the specific
		circumstances of any particular individual or
		entity;
		* not necessarily comprehensive, complete, accurate or up to
		date;
		* sometimes linked to external sites over which the Commission
		services
		have no control and for which the Commission assumes no
		responsibility;
		* not professional or legal advice (if you need
		specific advice, you
		should always consult a suitably qualified
		professional).

		Our goal is to keep this European TIN Portal and the TIN
		online check
		module timely and accurate. If errors are brought to our
		attention, we
		will do our best to correct them. EU Member States will
		notify the
		European Commission of any relevant change as soon as
		possible, and
		the European Commission will update the relevant pages as
		soon as
		possible according to the existing planning for modifications
		and
		maintenance.

		Please note that it cannot be guaranteed that a
		document available on-line
		exactly reproduces an officially adopted
		text. Only European Union
		legislation published in paper editions of
		the Official Journal of the
		European Union and national legislation
		published in compliance with
		applicable national legal provisions are
		deemed authentic.

		It is our goal to minimise disruption caused by
		technical errors.
		However, some data or information on the European TIN
		Portal may have
		been created or structured in files or formats that are
		not error-free
		and we cannot guarantee that our service will not be
		interrupted or
		otherwise affected by such problems. The Commission
		accepts no
		responsibility with regard to such problems incurred as a
		result of
		using the European TIN Portal or any linked external sites.

		This disclaimer is neither intended to limit the liability of the
		Commission in contravention of any requirements laid down in
		applicable national law nor exclude its liability for matters which
		may not be excluded under that law.


		Usage:
		The countryCode input
		parameter must follow the pattern [A-Z]{2}
		The tinNumber input
		parameter must not be empty

		In case of problem, the returned
		FaultString can take the following
		specific values:
		- INVALID_INPUT: The
		provided CountryCode is invalid or the TIN number
		is empty;
		-
		NO_INFORMATION: The Member State does not provide validity
		information;
		- SERVICE_UNAVAILABLE: The SOAP service is unavailable,
		try again
		later;
		- SERVER_BUSY: The service can't process your request.
		Try again
		latter.
